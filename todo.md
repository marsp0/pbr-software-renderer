## TODO

- [ ] 20.09.2023
    - [ ] remove scene and just keep everything in renderer?
- [ ] 5.08.2023
    - [ ] replace mat_new with mat_new_identity
- [ ] 18.06.2023
	- [ ] use mat_t* pointer instead of mat_t to avoid copying. [math]
	- [ ] Use SIMD for mat operations. [math]
	- [x] optimize clear operations on buffers, they are slow (close to 5ms); (21.07.2023)
		- depthbuffer_clear was taking 90% of the time. Moved the pointer redirection out of the loop + unrolled and is now running in 200us with O2
- [ ] 17.06.2023
	- [ ] improve the edge detection in the rasterizer [rasterizer]
- [ ] 16.06.2023
	- [ ] investigate if scene should be separate from renderer. The renderer just takes a scene as input and renders it [scene][renderer]
	- [ ] convert assert_* functions in test_utils to _ Generic function [test]
- [ ] 13.06.2023
	- [ ] investigate if view transform should be changed to match convention of yaw being yaw - 90 [camera][view]
- [ ] 22.04.2023
	- [ ] add quaternions to math.h
- [ ] 21.04.2023
	- [ ] investigate why XPutImage takes 1ms to complete. See if possible to imrove.
- [x] 20.04.2023
	- [x] both the frame buffer and the display have their own CHANNELS constants. Unify those,
		  and look at the memcpy note in display.c
- [ ] 19.04.2023
	- [ ] see if it makes sense to unify display and input into "platform"
	- [ ] handle "hold down" keys (for movement etc.)
	- [ ] remove color type
	- [ ] remove nanosleep from main loop and use the time to run updates. while (curr time < frame_time) -> run update; else -> render
- [ ] 17.04.2023
	- [ ] add support for camera in gltf.
	- [ ] add support for light settings in gltf. This might require extension
- [ ] 13.04.2023
	- [ ] allow for multiple meshes to be rendered
	- [x] parse multiple textures in parallel (20.08.2023)
- [ ] 11.04.2023 
	- [ ] separate mesh from textures. There can be a texture manager that handles all textures 
	and meshes can request the textures they need. (or similar)
	- [ ] Machinary blog explained how they do not permit including headers in headers (except for stdint). See if possible to do the same
	- [ ] if multiple nodes share a mesh then it will be duplicated. Should meshes share geometry info like textures? If we dont allow mesh edit then perhaps they should share.
	- [ ] Should static variables be grouped ? buffers + cursor + size etc.
	- [x] start using gcov to check code coverage and also detect dead/unused code.
- [x] 10.04.2023
	- [x] there is a test in test_json.c that fails ocasionally. (15.04.2023)
